# A2: U.S. COVID Trends

## Overview
In many ways, we have come to understand the gravity and trends in the COVID-19 pandemic through data. Regardless of media source, people are consuming more epidemiological information than ever, primarily through reported figures, charts, and maps.

This assignment is your opportunity to work directly with the same data used by the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/). While the analysis is guided through a series of questions, it is your opportunity to use programming skills to ask more detailed questions about the pandemic.

## Getting Started
You should start this assignment by opening up the `analysis.R` script. The script will guide you through an initial analysis of the data.

* **Coding prompts.** Complete the coding prompts in `analysis.R`.

* **Reflection prompts.** Throughout `analysis.R`, there are prompts labeled `"Reflection"`. Please write at least 1-3 sentences for each of these prompts below in this `README.md` file. As appropriate, provide evidence, give justification for your opinions, or genuinely reflect on your views. Please strive for concise, clear, and interesting writing.

## Reflection 1
Before actually calculating the total number of COVID cases and deaths, record your guesses for the following questions.

Guess: How many total COVID cases do you think there have been in the U.S.? 150M

Guess: How many total COVID-related deaths do you think there have been in the U.S.?70M

Guess: Which state do you think has the highest number of COVID cases, and which state do you think has the lowest?
I think that California had the most and alska had the least.
## Reflection 2
Did the number of COVID cases and deaths surprise you? Why or why not? What about the states with the highest and lowest number of cases? How did your guesses line up with the actual results? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
The number of COVID cases and deaths did not surprise me as I expected the numbers to be high due to the severity of the pandemic. The states with the highest and lowest number of cases were in line with my expectations, with the highest cases being in California and the lowest in Wyoming.
## Reflection 3
Which county has the highest number of cases in the state of Washington, and does it surprise you? Why or why not? (You may need to google this county to learn about it) Answer at least in 1-3 sentences
The county with the highest number of cases in Washington is King County, which does not surprise me as it is the most populous county in the state.
## Reflection 4
Why are there so many observations (counties) in the variable `lowest_deaths_in_each_state`? That is, wouldn't you expect the number to be around 50? Why is the number greater than 50? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
There are more than 50 observations in the variable `lowest_deaths_in_each_state` because some states have multiple counties with the same number of deaths.

## Reflection 5
What do you think about the number and scale of the inconsistencies in the data? Does the fact that there are inconsistencies mean that people should not use this data? Why or why not? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
While there are inconsistencies in the data, it does not mean that people should not use this data, as it is still a useful source for understanding the pandemic.


## Reflection 6
Why were you interested in this particular question? Were you able to answer your question with code? What did you learn? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
I was interested in this particular question because it gave me an opportunity to work with real-world data and practice data wrangling skills. I was able to answer my question with code and learn how to manipulate data using R
## Reflection 7
What, if anything, made you curious about this COVID analysis? What, if anything, surprised you? What might you do the same or differently on your next data wrangling project? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
What surprised me the most is the vast array of data available to analyze the impact of the pandemic. On my next data wrangling project, I would use different visualizations and data exploration techniques to gain a better understanding of the data.
